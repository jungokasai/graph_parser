## Requirements

TensorFlow needs to be installed before running the training script.
TensorFlow 1.0.0 or higher is supported. (TensorFlow 1.3.0 and 1.7.0 are tested)

## GloVe

Our architecture utilizes pre-trained word embedding vectors, [GloveVectors](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). Run the following:
```bash
wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip 
```
and save it to a sub-directory glovevector/. 

## Data Format
The biaffine parser takes as input a file in the Conllu+Supertag (conllustag) format, in which one column for supertags is added to the original conllu format at the end. See a [sample](sample_data/conllu/sample.conllustag).

## <a name="train"></a>Train a Parser
All you need to do is to create a new directory for your data in the conllustag format  and a json file for the model configuration and data information. We provide a [sample json file](sample_data/config_demo.json) for the [sample](sample_data) data directory. You can train a parser on the sample data by the following command:
```bash
python train_graph_parser.py sample_data/config_demo.json
```
After running this command, you should be getting the following files and directories in sample_data/:

| Directory/File | Description |
|------|--------|
|checkpoint.txt|Contains information about the best model.|
|sents/|Contains the words in the one-sentence-per-line format|
|gold_pos/|Contains the gold POS tags in the one-sentence-per-line format|
|gold_stag/|Contains the gold supertags in the one-sentence-per-line format|
|arcs/|Contains the gold arcs in the one-sentence-per-line format|
|rels/|Contains the gold rels in the one-sentence-per-line format|
|predicted_arcs/|Contains the predicted arcs in the one-sentence-per-line format|
|predicted_rels/|Contains the gold rels in the one-sentence-per-line format|
|Parsing_Models/|Stores the best model.|
|conllu/sample.conllustag_stag|Contains the predicted supertags in the conllustag format|

## <a name="structure"></a>Structure of the Code
| File | Description |
|------|--------|
|``utils/preprocessing.py``|Contains tools for preprocessing. Mainly for tokenizing and indexing words/tags. Gets imported to ``utils/data_process_secsplit.py``|
|``utils/data_process_secsplit.py``|Reads training and test data and tokenize/index words, POS tags, stags, and characters.|
|``utils/parsing_model.py``|Contains the ``Parsing_Model`` class that constructs our LSTM computation graph. The class has the necessary methods for training and testing. Gets imported to ``bilstm_stagger_model.py``. For more details, read [README for utils](utils/README.md).|
|``utils/lstm.py``|Contains tensorflow LSTM equations. Gets imported to ``utils/stagging_model.py``.|
|``graph_parser_model.py``|Contains functions that instantiate the ``Parsing_Model`` class and train/test a model. Gets imported to ``graph_parser_main.py``|
|``graph_parser_main.py``|Main file to run experiments. Reads model and data options.|
|``scripts/train_graph_parser.py``|Runs ``graph_parser_main.py`` in bash according to the json file that gets passed.|


## <a name="pretrained"></a>Run a pre-trained TAG Parser
We provide a pre-trained TAG parser.
To run the pretrained parser on your data, first [download the model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HRTQp1pBWBShE7eIVENLL6__ELi-snzO) and place the ``Pretrained_Parser`` directory in the ``demo`` directory. Then, run

- With tokenization
```bash
python demo/scripts/demo_model.py --infile demo/sents/test.txt --tokenize
```
- Without tokenization
```bash
python demo/scripts/demo_model.py --infile demo/sents/test.tokenized.txt
```
You can replace these files by your own data. It prints out predicted elementary trees, parses, and PTB-style fine-grained POS tags in the conllu format. Note that we put elementary trees in the UPOS column.

## <a name="demo"></a>Run a demo TAG Parser
Enjoy playing around with [our TAG demo parser](http://michelangelo.ling.yale.edu/) online!
